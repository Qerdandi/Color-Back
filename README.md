# Color Back
## Context:
It's a training project to learn how to manipulate the 2D mechanics in Unity including the tilemap tool and how to use post processing through scripts. It was also the opportunity to start writing a game design document.
## Story:
All the colors of the world have disappeared giving way to sadness, desolation and a world in black and white. The cause is, but no one knows, an evil creature that has absorbed the different colors that make up white light (violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red). Your mission, huntress, will be to investigate the cause of this curse and eliminate the creature in order to bring back all the colors and save the world.
