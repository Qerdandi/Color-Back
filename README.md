# Color Back
## Context:
It's a training project to learn how to manipulate the 2D mechanics in Unity including the tilemap tool and how to use post processing through scripts. It was also the opportunity to start writing a game design document. You can find from this repository the scripts used and the all different assets drew (characters and maps components).

## Story:
After losing all its colors, the world sank into sadness and despair. You will have to venture into an open world in order to discover the reason for this curse and end it. To do this, armed with your lucky revolver, you will venture into a multi-faceted world, search for clues and interrogate its inhabitants. Be careful, the danger is omnipresent.

All the colors of the world have disappeared giving way to sadness, desolation and a world in black and white. The cause is, but no one knows, an evil creature that has absorbed the different colors that make up white light (violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red). Your mission, huntress, will be to investigate the cause of this curse and eliminate the creature in order to bring back all the colors and save the world.
